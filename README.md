## Description
Using the starter code, I was instructed to fix the starter code without changing the aspect of it. I created a function to allow the generate button to be clicked on by the user and then the user is presented with a prompt and confirm windows to refine what kind of password the user wants. After answering the prompts the browser will then display the generated password.
#
## What does the application do?
This application creates a randomized generated password, it starts by giving the user prompts asking what kind of characters they would like to include in their password. Then the new generated password is presented.
#
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
